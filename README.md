# How does it work?

Piezo buzzers are simple devices that can generate basic beeps and tones. They work by using a piezo crystal, a special material that changes shape when voltage is applied to it. If the crystal pushes against a diaphram, like a tiny speaker cone, it can generate a pressure wave which the human ear picks up as sound.
